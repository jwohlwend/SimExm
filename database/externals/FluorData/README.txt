Excitation and emission spectra are supplied here for 10 dyes.

For most dyes, there is 1nm resolution. For BUV737 and BV605, there is 10nm resolution (but it's inconsistent) because I was doing it by hand from the associated jpgs, and chose datapoints to minimize work and make the figure look pretty. It's probably reasonable to extrapolate linearly, or if you're very keen you could go through and tabulate it with higher resolution.

For quantum efficiency (typically denoted by eta) and extinction coefficient (denoted by epsilon_max), you can find this data online. The Alexa dyes are manufactured by Life technologies, the Atto dyes are manufactured by Attotec, and the BUV and BV dyes are manufactured by BD biosciences.
